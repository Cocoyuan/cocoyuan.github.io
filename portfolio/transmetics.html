						<h3>Problem</h3>
						
						<p>Current French skin care products only have French descriptions on package, making it hard for non-native French speakers to understand. What's more, People find it hard to seek for cosmetics that are suitable for their skin type. Starting from the problem, we conducted questionnaires and interviews to know more about our target users.</p>
					
						
						<h3>Questionnaires</h3>
						<p>Gave away both Chinese and English version of questionnaires in front of a local pharmacy. Our target users were non-French speakers including Chinese and English-speaking people from other countries. Total number: 35. The key findings were as below.</p>

						<h3>Scenarios</h3>
						<h4>Persona</h4>
						<p>Bingbing, female, Chinese, 26 years old, workplace new, non-French speaker, care about her skin, has passions in cosmetics, travelling in France at present.</p>
						<h4>Scenario - When purchasing: </h4>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/transmetics/scenario1.png" /></span>Bingbing has heard a lot about the populartity of French cosmetics, so she comes inside a Pharmacy and want to buy something suitable for herself. However she had a hard time choosing which one to buy. When she see a cosmetic is in discount, she is curious about what is the product used for. So she use Transmetics to scan the barcode of the product and it gives her the information that she cares most about the product. Then Bingbing find two similar products which she both like and she can not decide which one to buy. She use the double scan function to scan the barcodes of the two cosmetics and get the comparison information between them.</p>

						<h4>Scenario - Before/ After purchasing:  </h4>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/transmetics/scenario1.png" alt="" /></span>Coming out of the pharmacy after buying some products, Bingbing wants to find more good French cosmetics. So she opens the Transmetics application at her room and see some recommendations of cosmetics about her skin types. She reads the Chinese descriptions of it and thinks it's suitable for her. Then she click the heart button to add the product to her collections so that she can check it next time she buy cosmetics.
