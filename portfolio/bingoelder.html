							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In this project our group has the aim to create an android-application, which suppose to reconnect elderly people to the society and give them the possibility to do that with the fun factor. To make the access easier and increase the acceptance, we take out any kind of seriousness and choose a game. And because of the degree of familiarity among the elderly, we chose Bingo that can be played with family, friends and even complete strangers to help them meet new people through this game and have fun while playing.</p>

						<h3>Problem</h3>
						
						<p>Since the improvements in medicine and healthcare, the age of population in the world is getting older and older. By 2020 more 25% of european population will be aged above 60 and out of those majority will be aged more than 75. This demographic change grows the society of the elderly and generates or increase problems we have to face. One of these problems is that more and more seniors lost connection to the rest of the world and live in loneliness and isolation. Some reasons could be the death of the partner, far away livness of family and friends or the loss of the ability to leave the home or even worse, the bed. The loss of the connection to the community has negative impact on psychical and physical condition of these persons. We want to help those people to find a way back to the community with the use of technology and let them regain some piece of quality of life.</p>

						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>First of all, we cannot solve the isolation problem of the elderly with an application, but we can increase the quality of somebody’s life. To achieve this we chose to design an application to reconnect the elderly to the society.We chose a game for several reasons:
						<ol>
							<li>Nearly everybody wants to play something in some way. When we meet this need, the acceptance of the application increases.</li>
							<li>A game is basically not a serious context, that means that they can just have fun without the pressure to get something serious done.</li>
							<li>The playing itself generates some context to talk about after the game.</li>
							<li>A game, which cannot played alone, automatically force the user to interact with other people. And the goal is to reconnect people.</li>
						</ol>
						Because of the degree of familiarity not least under seniors we chose Bingo. Additionally the basic rules are quite simple, easy explained, mostly common knowledge and can easily be edited to increase fun and the replayability. 
						</p>
						<h3>Use Cases</h3>
						<p>To fulfill the requirements our bingoapp offer several use-cases:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The game itself:</li>
							This includes the actual gaming, as well as the variety of different winning patterns or the size of the bingo-card.
							<li>Friend-system:</li>
							A simple reconnection to the society is not quite helpful, when state breaks after a short duration or when it is not possible do forge bounds at all. For that reason the app will contain some kind of friend-system similar to a messenger like Skype or Facebook. Friends can easily found and invited to a game.
							<li>Creating a game:</li>
							The user who creates the game (lobby) is automatically the game-master of the created lobby and have to do the settings for the game. Part of the settings are amongst others how many players he want to play with or the pattern for a Bingo. Inside the lobby, he decides when the game starts and can invite friends.
							<li>Joining a game:</li>
							Isolated people mostly do not have many friends. As a conclusion the user have to be able to play with complete strangers. If the user wants to join he game, he gets a list of open lobbys and can join by clicking on them.
							<li>Player registration:</li>
							To get some kind of Avatar and differ between the accounts of the users a registration is needed. This can be done by the installation threw the people who installed it, that simplify the app for the elderly.
							<li>Chatting:</li>
							This is nearly the most important usecase. With this feature the users are able to truly communicate with each other instead of just playing and only see the avatars. We choose chatting instead of video- or audio-communication because with more players it gets very crowded and the space on the screen is limited. Chatting takes place in 2 possible locations. The first one is the lobby, where the user can chat with each other while they are waiting for more players. After a game, the players are directed back to the lobby and can talk about the game. The second place is in the friend-system. This will look alike a common messenger. This allowed the user to build new bounds to the society and to maintain these bounds.
						</ul>
						<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
						<p>According to the use cases we defined in this application, we basically decided how is the information architecture of this tablet app looks like.</p>

						<h3>Wireframe</h3>
						<p>Based on the information architecture, we had agreement on the basic functionality in MVP of this game tablet app, here is our wireframe.</p>

						<p></p>
						<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
						<p>After the UI design and structure define, the overview of interaction flow shows as below:</p>
						<img src="../images/bingoelder/userflow.png" width="100%" /><br>

						<h3>User Test</h3>
						<p>For this Study participates 30 (25 male, 5 female) people between the age of 18 and 30. Even though that technically elderly people are needed for this investigation, mostly students where chosen because of a lack of funds and time. The test process shows below:
						<img src="../images/bingoelder/usertest.png" width="100%" />
						There are two charts simply explained the results of this study. The first and second chart shown all non-significant dimensions and significant dimensions respectively. 
						<img src="../images/bingoelder/chart1.png" width="100%" />
						The last chart the relative improvement in percentage of the significant dimensions. Negative values are a decrease and positive values a increase compared to the first round.
						<img src="../images/bingoelder/chart3.png" width="60%" /><br>
						</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>The goal was to reduce the isolation and loneliness of elderly people and here is an prototype that should helping to address this problem. Even in this early state of development the study shows an improvement in social bounding which will probably increase when future work is realized.<br>
						It is shown how effective notifications about the progress compared with a limited number of chat massages can be to enhance social bonds. The Bingo prototype is on a good way to be an effective tool fighting against isolation among the elderly and probably be able to have a big impact on those people.</p>
