						<h5>Motivation</h5>
						<p>Important factors that are calculated into pedestrian’s decision to cross the road include not only the vehicle’s speed but also the interactions with the driver (e.g., eye-contact, gestures, or head movement). However, with the rapid development of autonomous vehicle(AV), how will pedestrians make the decision in road crossing without human driver involved? </p>

						<!-- <h5>Problem</h5>
						<p>Current French skin care products only have French descriptions on package, making it <b>hard for non-native French speakers to understand</b>. What's more, People find it <b>hard to seek for cosmetics that are suitable for their skin type</b>. Starting from the problem, we conducted questionnaires and interviews to know more about our target users.</p>
 -->
						<h5>Methodology</h5>
						<p>The purpose of this research was to investigate the usability of the designed communication concept that explicitly communicate intent of autonomous vehicle to pedestrians, focusing on conflict situations. The research relied on three-phase design process with focus group, participatory design and the user study approaches. The first two approaches aimed to gain insight on designing the communication concept, Based on the outcomes, we developed prototype videos and assessed them in the user study. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the form of post-study interview and questionnaire to explain the participant’s experience on designed concept.</p>

						<p class="col-sm-6"><small>Bingbing has heard a lot about the populartity of French cosmetics, so she comes inside a Pharmacy and want to buy something suitable for herself. However she had a hard time choosing which one to buy. When she see a cosmetic is in discount, she is curious about what is the product used for. So she use Transmetics to scan the barcode of the product and it gives her the information that she cares most about the product. Then Bingbing find two similar products which she both like and she can not decide which one to buy. She use the double scan function to scan the barcodes of the two cosmetics and get the comparison information between them.</small></p>

						<p class="col-sm-6"><small>Coming out of the pharmacy after buying some products, Bingbing wants to find more good French cosmetics. So she opens the Transmetics application at her room and see some recommendations of cosmetics about her skin types. She reads the Chinese descriptions of it and thinks it's suitable for her. Then she click the heart button to add the product to her collections so that she can check it next time she buy cosmetics. Also she collects the tags that she cares such as her skin type and some useful functions.</small></p>

						<h5>UX Academy</h5>
						<p>This was my initial individual task to bring UX knowledge to team and provide trainings. By this internal UX academy site, roche employee could get the academic resources easily, get the quick guide to run a design-thinking workshop(agenda, slide template, tool kit), and find the in-house potential collaboration. In the end this became cross-team project with positive feedback, and still on going after I left. This the post of the site.</p>

						<h5>Results</h5>
						<p>The results indicate that in the AV-pedestrian communication concept: </p>

						<ul>
						<li>The interface with relevant traffic light signal can be an effective signal to help pedestrians making the cross decision;</li>
						<li>The explicit time expression is rather preferred when there is a certain crossing time period, especially for younger pedestrians;</li>
						<li>Virtual driver could help pedestrians to distinguish vehicle’s driving mode, and it can increase perceived safety of AV for elder pedestrians.</li>
					
						</ul>
